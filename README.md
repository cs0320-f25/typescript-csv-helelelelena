# Sprint 1: TypeScript CSV

### Task C: Proposing Enhancement

- #### Step 1: Brainstorm on your own.
    Send a message to the user if they for some reason submit the wrong file // no file
    Potentially use not only comma, but other values as separators
    Handle different value types
    Quotes within quotes 
    "\n" inside rows instead of as separators

- #### Step 2: Use an LLM to help expand your perspective.
    empty field and missing fields: ,, or undefined/null?
    headers
    If one row has more or fewer fields than the header, does the parser crash, skip, or try to fix it?
    Can the parser handle very large CSVs without loading everything into memory at once?
    If parsing fails, do I get a helpful error message with line number & column?
    Can I stop after the first N rows (like for preview)?

- #### Step 3: use an LLM to help expand your perspective.

    Include a list of the top 4 enhancements or edge cases you think are most valuable to explore in the next week’s sprint. Label them clearly by category (extensibility vs. functionality), and include whether they came from you, the LLM, or both. Describe these using the User Story format—see below for a definition. 

    Include your notes from above: what were your initial ideas, what did the LLM suggest, and how did the results differ by prompt? What resonated with you, and what didn’t? (3-5 sentences.)
